This script helps centralize some of the more basic WinCollect troubleshooting commands into a basic GUI for Managed WinCollect.

Some of the actions include:
- starting, stopping, and checking the WinCollect service
- Opening and Searching the wincollect log
- Checking the specific ports for a list of hosts
- View/Edit the config endpoints
- Generate a new PEM for the WinCollect agent
